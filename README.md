# React + TypeScript + Vite + ArcGIS Maps SDK for JS

This template provides a rough and ready rudimentary example of how to use [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) with React and Typescript to display a simple map with points.

## Getting setup
Clone the repo and then run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

The ArcGIS SDK is huge and will take a while.

Run locally by `npm run dev` and you should see an interactive map and table.

## Data
 
The point data is mocked JSON for random location in the middle of WA desert.
